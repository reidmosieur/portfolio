### SaaS Starter

**[View on GitHub →](https://github.com/reidmosieur/saas-starter)**

A no-frills SaaS starter kit that shows how I’d architect a production-ready, multi-tenant app with organizations, auth, and billing. It’s minimal, but functional—clone it, test it, break it.

**What’s Included:**

- Auth with email/password + Google SSO
- Org-based RBAC with invites
- Custom onboarding flows
- Session handling (with IP enrichment)
- Billing-ready (Stripe)
- Built with Next.js, Tailwind, Prisma, and Shadcn

I’ve leaned into practical design choices—dates instead of booleans, recursive onboarding, and a simple auth strategy that doesn’t rely on third-party abstractions. Auth isn’t magic, and you don’t need to overcomplicate it.

This starter focuses on flexibility, clarity, and scale. It’s not polished, but it’s battle-ready.
